## **Description of Portfolio Website.**  
  
### **Purpose of Website**

- The purpose of my portfolio website is to create a professional platform in which I can demonstrate my abilities to future employers.
- The website in turn provides the audience with not only the current state of my talents, abilities and coding experience but an insight into my personality, professional knowledge, interests, hobbies and mindset.
- At its core the website was a project as well as a great indicator of where my strengths and weaknesses lie.
  In turn it has created an internal 'roadmap' depicting a more visual understanding of the direction I wish to take on my coding journey.

### **Functionality & Features of Website**

#### **Functionality:**

- The website was designed with the intention of a user friendly experience.
- The content depicted throughout the website fulfils the desired purpose in a manner that allows the user to extract the information and data in an easy and fluent fashion.
- The website's functionality translates across all platforms;
  - Desktop
  - Tablets
  - Mobile devices.

#### **Features:**

- The colour schemes and font styling makes the website very appealing, colourful and welcoming.
- The nav-bar allows for easy navigation between all pages of the website including the individual blog pages themselves.
- The nav-bar 'secondary mode' on mobile devices allows for even further ease of navigation.
- The use of the 'burger' icon over the entire nav-bar creates less of a cluster on mobile devices aiding in the websites visual appearance.
  - A very interesting and 'playful' feature is the 'popup-boxes' on the About Me page.
  - This not only prevents the user for having to scroll down the page to obtain information, but gives the experience a sense of interactivity between the website, myself and the user.

### **Sitemap**

- From initial development of my website, I wanted a very simplistic structure that offered a user friendly interaction alongside smooth navigation between all pages of the site.
