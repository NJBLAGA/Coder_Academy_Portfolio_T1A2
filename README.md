## **Description of Portfolio Website.**  
  
### **Purpose of Website**

- The purpose of my portfolio website is to create a professional platform in which I can demonstrate my abilities to future employers.
- The wesbite in turn provides the audience with not only the current state of my talents, abilities and coding experince but an insight into my personailty, professional knowledge, interests, hobbies and mindset.
- At its core the website was a project as well as a great indicator of where my strengths and weaknessess lie.
  In turn it has created an internal 'roadmap' depicting a more visual understanding of which direction I wish to take on my coding journey.
